This application is an OTP generator based on the HMAC-based One-Time Password (OTP) algorithm. The application generates a unique one-time password (OTP) based on the data entered by the user. To generate an OTP, a secret key is used, which must be known to both the OTP generator and the client, as well as a unique value that the client issues. The generated OTP is displayed in a text field and stored in the device memory. The user can generate a new OTP by entering a secret key and a unique value. The application also contains error handling and displays appropriate notifications if not all fields are filled in.
